### Vulnerability Scanning with Nessus | Security Blue Team Training

During my training with Security Blue Team, I had the opportunity to explore the realm of vulnerability management and scanning. One of the pivotal tools in this journey was Nessus, a robust vulnerability scanner.

#### Key Highlights: 

- **In-Depth Learning:** I delved into the intricacies of Nessus, honing my skills in identifying and assessing vulnerabilities within systems and networks.

- **Comprehensive Scanning:** I conducted various scans, including authenticated scans for detailed assessment and unauthenticated scans to simulate external threats.

- **Risk Assessment:** Analyzing scan results, I gained the ability to evaluate the risk posed by each vulnerability, considering factors such as severity and potential impact.

- **Proactive Mitigation:** With a prioritized approach, I formulated remediation strategies to address vulnerabilities efficiently.

This experience not only enriched my technical acumen but also underscored the significance of continuous monitoring and proactive security measures.

Stay tuned for more endeavors as I continue my journey in the cybersecurity landscape!
